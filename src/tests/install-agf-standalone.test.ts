 * Static contract test for scripts/install-agf-standalone.sh (node_f6e5e24c578b).
 * A real subprocess exercise (fixture HTTP server + spawnSync bash) was tried
 * first but this sandbox blocks network calls from a nested child process
 * (curl via spawnSync hangs even against 127.0.0.1) — confirmed by isolating a
 * bare `spawnSync('curl', ...)` against a local Node http server, which hangs
 * identically. Manual `bash scripts/install-agf-standalone.sh` from the Bash
 * tool directly (not nested) DOES work end-to-end (verified once against a
 * local python http.server fixture). Falling back to a static-contract
 * pattern: prove the AC by reading the script source, not executing it.
 *
 * NOTE on the limits of that pattern: its sibling for Windows
 * (install-agf-ps1.test.ts) stayed GREEN for days after v0.24.0 retired the
 * `.exe`, because reading a source only proves the source says what you asked —
 * never that the asset it names still exists. Both were retired. If this file
 * ever outlives the channel it describes, delete it rather than update it.
