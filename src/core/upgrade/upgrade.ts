 * upgrade — pure self-update logic (no I/O): map the running platform to its
 * fixed release asset name, compare semver, and decide whether to upgrade.
 *
 * Assets are served from the project's own release channel under FIXED names (no
 * version in the filename), so a binary always pulls "latest" for its OS/arch.
 * Override with AGF_RELEASES_BASE — a mirror, an air-gapped copy, or GitHub.
 *
 * PRIVACY, stated plainly: this fetch reaches a host the author operates, so it
 * discloses your IP and the version you run. That is the ONLY such request agf
 * makes, it happens exactly when you type `agf upgrade`, and never otherwise —
 * no startup check, no background refresh, no fingerprint. The release host is
 * configured to keep no access log for /releases/ and stores no download record.
 * Verify the "never otherwise" half yourself: src/tests/local-first-no-network.ts
 * fails the build if any other module reaches this host.
 *
 * Composes with: upgrade-runner.ts (orchestration + injected ports),
 *               cli/commands/upgrade-cmd.ts (real fetch/fs wiring).
