 * Which task earned the tokens a lever saved.
 *
 * WHY it exists: `economy_lever_ledger` held 167 rows with `node_id` NULL on every one. The
 * total was real — 6,991 tokens, measured against baselines you can argue with — but it belonged
 * to nobody, so it could not be audited, and a benchmark run was indistinguishable from a day of
 * work. Sixty-three percent of that total turned out to be one afternoon of probing the retriever.
 *
 * WHY the WIP node: the graph already answers the question. WIP=1 is the project's own invariant,
 * so at most one node is `in_progress` at any moment. A lever that fires while a task is being
 * worked belongs to that task; one that fires with nothing in progress belongs to nothing — and
 * that absence is the signal, because that is precisely what a benchmark looks like.
 *
 * WHY it abstains: the invariant is enforced, not guaranteed — `--force` and a crashed loop both
 * break it. Two candidates means the ledger cannot know which earned the tokens, and a ledger that
 * guesses is worse than one that admits it does not know.
 *
 * Contract: `currentTaskId(db)` returns a node id or null, and never throws. Attribution is
 * telemetry; it must not take a command down with it.
 *
 * Composes with: economy-lever-ledger.ts (writes the row), rag-in/economy.ts and
 * rag-out/economy.ts (`toLeverEvent(e, sessionId, nodeId?)` — the parameter was there from the
 * start; nobody passed it).
