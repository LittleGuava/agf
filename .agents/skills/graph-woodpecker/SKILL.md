# graph-woodpecker

The hardener. An autonomous, perpetual loop that hunts flaws out of an existing
codebase — bugs, security vulnerabilities, quality rot, logging/observability blind
spots — files each as a graph node, and fixes it with a regression test first (TDD),
raising coverage to ≥80% and wiring observability as it goes. Like a woodpecker
extracting grubs from inside the wood: methodical, persistent, leaves the tree
healthier. The third pillar after PLAN and BUILD.

## When to Use

- The feature exists and works, but you want it **hardened**: bugs, vulns, debt removed
- A security/quality/coverage audit is due, or a flaky/regression hotspot needs attention
- Coverage is below 80%, logs are thin, or failures are silent (no observability)
- You want `agf` to continuously self-heal its own defects, autonomously

Do NOT use to plan a PRD (→ `graph-backlog-generation`) or to build a new backlog
feature (→ `graph-builder-leafcutter`). This skill improves what already exists.

## ⛔ Hard rule — every flaw becomes a node, every fix has a test (read this first)

When this skill is invoked you may **never fix a flaw silently**. The order is fixed:
**FIND → file a `bug`/`risk` node → reproduce with a FAILING test → fix → prove green.**
No regression test that first reproduces the defect = you have not fixed it, you have
guessed. No node for the flaw = it never existed and you cannot claim it `done`
(anti-vibe-coding). You **own git** (branch-per-fix → TDD → merge → commit → delete) and
you **never lower a bar to pass** — if a gate is red, fix the code or file a node, never
weaken the test, the lint rule, or the coverage threshold. Observability is part of the
fix, not a follow-up: a failure path with no log/metric is not done.

## Deterministic loop (low-reasoning fast-path)

If you are a low-reasoning model (Haiku 4.5, DeepSeek Flash v4, MiniMax, etc.), follow
THIS exactly — top to bottom, no judgement. Obey every **STOP**/**DEFAULT**. The rich
Workflow below is the same loop for stronger models; this is the compiled version.

1. **Gate check (version + pull next hardening target):**
   `agf next --aco --select data.id` → if `NO_TASKS`:
   - `hardBlocks[]` non-empty → log blocked runtimes, wait (do NOT signal exhausted).
   - `hardBlocks[]` empty + backlog non-empty → escalate: "blocked — nothing unblocked".
   - backlog empty → proceed to the Hunt scan below (harden the codebase directly).
2. **Hunt (collect findings, ~0 token, deterministic):** encapsule a varredura num
   único round-trip com `agf exec chain` (sem shell `&&`/`|`) — menos envelopes, menos tokens:
   ```bash
   agf exec chain "harness --violations --select data.violations; \
     gaps --severity required --select data; \
     gaps --kind phantom_done --select data; \
     lint --select data; \
     insights --select data.hotspots"
   # harness=quality/types/docs/naming/errors · gaps required=missing tests/AC/edge/errors
   # gaps phantom_done=ANTI-HALLUCINATION (done tasks whose testFiles não existem no disco)
   # lint=lint+security · insights=regression/churn hotspots
   ```
   > `exec chain` funciona em dev e no binário (fix `665d0a91`) e agora emite `ok:false`
   > se um step falhar — ainda assim, confirme o efeito de cada varredura, não só o `ok`.
   > **Um step que falha com "invalid JSON"/"Unexpected token" NÃO é ruído — é um achado.**
   > O comando daquele step violou o contrato de stdout do CLI: emitiu texto cru ANTES/junto
   > do envelope JSON. A causa-raiz clássica é um `spawnSync(..., { stdio: 'inherit' })` de uma
   > ferramenta externa (eslint, tsc, git) que despeja o output humano no stdout, enquanto o
   > mesmo comando também chama `out.ok()` — o stdout fica com texto+JSON e nenhum consumidor
   > (jq, exec chain, `--select`) parseia. Fix: CAPTURE o output do child (`encoding:'utf8'`,
   > nunca `inherit`) e ESTRUTURE-o em `data`; emita só o envelope. Sinal de detecção grátis:
   > `agf <cmd> --select data.x | jq .` — se `jq` engasga, o comando está furando o contrato.
   > (Corrigido assim em `agf lint`; a mesma assinatura vale para qualquer wrapper de tool.)
   > **Triangulation (anti-hallucination).** A task is only really delivered when AC ↔ code ↔
   > **physical test** all align. `phantom_done` crosses `status=done` against the filesystem on
   > BOTH axes — `testFiles` (test) and `implementationFiles` (code): a done task declaring a
   > file that isn't on disk is a hallucination — file it as a finding and remediate (write the
   > missing file, or fix the reference via `agf node update <id> --test-files|--implementation-files
<real files…>`). This is the hardening leg the graph-only gaps could not see.
   >
   > **⛔ BEFORE remediating a `phantom_done`, triage WHY the file is absent — `git log --all --
<path>` (+ `--diff-filter=D`). Absent ≠ never-built.** Three cases: (a) **never-built** (no
   > history) → build it or reopen; (b) **stale-reference** (the deliverable exists under another
   > name) → fix the pointer, don't rebuild; (c) **deliberately deleted** — a commit removed it on
   > purpose (message like "remove network/telemetry/unsolicited", "local-first", "deprecate",
   > "privacy") → the task is **OBSOLETE / superseded**: `agf node rm` it (archive), and **NEVER
   > rebuild — rebuilding is a regression that re-opens the exact hole the deletion closed.** Earned
   > the hard way: a `phantom_done` for `update-notifier`/`update-notify-cli` was "resolved" by
   > rebuilding — silently re-introducing the phone-home (leaked IP+version on every `agf` invocation)
   > that a prior commit had deliberately removed to make the tool local-first. The enforcement guard
   > (`local-first-no-network.test.ts`) caught it, but **`npm run test:blast` (`vitest --changed`,
   > module-graph) did NOT** — that guard reads source as a STRING (no import edge), so a per-task
   > blast never marks it affected. Lesson twofold: **check the reason for absence, not just the
   > absence**, and know that **content-scan guards are invisible to `--changed` blast** — run them
   > standalone (smoke/pre-commit) when your change could trip one.
   >
   > **A second, subtler phantom-value class: real code + real test, but the artifact never
   > reaches its actual consumer.** File-existence triangulation only proves code and test
   > exist — it does NOT prove the thing built ever ships. Found twice this session: a build
   > script (`build-linux-packages.sh`) was fully implemented and covered by 7 real tests, yet
   > was never called from any CI workflow — no user could ever download the artifact it
   > produced. A packaging script (`pack-offline.mjs`) wrote a correctly-named file, but the
   > release workflow's `gh release upload` step never included it, so it never reached the
   > public release either. Whenever a finding is "a script/module exists and is tested,"
   > trace the chain ONE HOP FURTHER: what invokes this in production (a CI workflow, a cron,
   > an npm script)? Does THAT invocation actually run, and does its output reach the real
   > consumer (a Release asset, a published package)? `grep` the script's own filename across
   > `.github/workflows/*.yml` and any orchestrating shell script — zero hits means the tested
   > code is dormant in the one place that matters.
3. **File every finding as a node (never fix silently):**
   `agf node add --type bug "<symptom + file:line>"` for a defect; `--type risk` for a
   vuln/quality/observability gap. One node per flaw. No node → it does not get fixed.
4. **Pick order (no math):** `security` → `data-loss/crash` → `failing test` →
   `quality/complexity` → `logging gap`. Tie → lowest id. One at a time (WIP=1).
5. `agf node status <id> in_progress`.
6. **Reproduce first (RED):** write the test that _fails because of this flaw_ — for a
   bug, the input that triggers it; for a vuln, the malicious input. Run it, see it FAIL.
   Cannot reproduce → add a `risk` note and **STOP** that item (do not blind-fix).
7. **Fix minimal → GREEN.** Then **observability in the same change:** the failure path
   gets a structured log (`createLogger`, never `console.log`) + a metric/counter if it
   is a hot path. A silent failure path = not done.
8. **Coverage gate ≥80%:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:blast            # transitively-affected tests, standalone, must be green
   agf tdd-score <id> --select data.score   # ≥80; below → add positive+negative+edge tests
   ```
   Below 80% → keep adding tests (this is mandatory). **Max 3 fix tries** on a red blast;
   still red → `agf node add --type bug` and **STOP**.
9. **Security pass (every fix):** run the OWASP/STRIDE checklist below; any new exposure
   → `agf node add --type risk`. Never introduce a `console.log`, secret, or `any`.
10. `agf check <id>` (DoD) → `agf done <id>` (honest gate). Red on an **unrelated**
    pre-existing test → `agf node add --type risk …`, then
    `agf done <id> --test-cmd "npx vitest run <your test file>"`.
11. `agf memory write pheromone-fix-<slug>` (root cause + the fix + the gotcha) → go to 1.

**Never:** fix without a reproducing test, weaken a gate to pass, leave a failure path
silent, mark done on a false claim, or hold >1 `in_progress`.

## Golden Rules (woodpecker edition)

> The full universal set lives in `_shared.md` → **Golden Rules (universal
> engineering)** — obey it verbatim; the list below is the hardening-specific slice.
> Sweep handoffs MUST follow `_shared.md` → **Close-out Report Format** (delivery
> table + Achado transversal + Honestidade + `Próximo: X — porque [fundamento]`).

1. **Find before you fix; reproduce before you trust.** A bug you cannot reproduce in a
   test is a hypothesis, not a defect. Differential debugging / bisection finds _when_;
   the test proves _what_.
2. **Graph is the source of truth.** Every flaw is a `bug`/`risk` node; code/graph beat
   memory. No node = no fix.
3. **Root cause, not symptom.** Apply **5 Whys** + **Ishikawa (fishbone)** until the test
   that fails maps to the true cause — fix that, not the surface.
4. **Security is a first-class flaw.** Treat input as hostile (**STRIDE** + **OWASP Top
   10** + CWE). Parameterize queries, validate at boundaries (Zod), no secrets in code,
   least privilege. A found vuln is filed and fixed like any bug.
5. **Quality is a gate, not prose.** Clean Code · SOLID · KISS · YAGNI + McCabe
   complexity, enforced by `harness`/`tdd-score`/`check` — file <800, fn <50, 1
   responsibility, no `any`, typed errors, zero dead code.
6. **Coverage ≥80%, tests that bite.** Test Pyramid + FIRST + AAA; positive + negative +
   edge per fix; mutation kill-ratio ≥0.60 where it matters. Characterization tests pin
   legacy behavior before you touch it.
7. **Observability from the start.** No silent failures: structured logs on error paths,
   metrics on hot paths (RED: Rate/Errors/Duration · USE: Utilization/Saturation/Errors).
8. **Honesty + dogfood.** Surface every loose end as a node; never fake-pass; in-repo use
   `npm run dev -- <cmd>`, never the stale installed binary.
9. **A guard is only a guard while it can still fail.** A mass rename or codemod rewrites
   the test alongside the code, and the test stays green — because it now asserts a
   tautology. The classic shape: a guard strips the allowed exception from a string, then
   greps the remainder for the forbidden term. Rename the term and the grep can never
   match again; the assertion passes for every input, forever, and nothing tells you.
   After any sweep that touches an assertion, **prove each guard still bites**: put the
   forbidden thing back — into the artifact the guard actually reads, not merely into a
   file whose name resembles it — and watch it go red. A guard that has never been seen
   to fail has not been tested; it has been assumed. Applies equally to the guards you
   write today: the first run of a new guard must be RED, before the fix exists.

## Mandatory Flow

```
HUNT (harness·gaps·lint·insights → findings) → FILE nodes (bug/risk) → pick by severity (WIP=1)
  → REPRODUCE (failing test, RED) → ROOT-CAUSE (5 Whys/bisect) → FIX minimal (GREEN)
  → OBSERVABILITY (log + metric on the failure/hot path) → COVERAGE ≥80% (tdd-score)
  → SECURITY pass (STRIDE/OWASP) → GATES (blast·check·harness) → done (honest)
  → learn (pheromone) → repeat until no findings → re-scan
```

WIP = 1 (Little's Law: CT = WIP/TH). Deep methodology lives in the knowledge-base skills
(load on demand): `effective-debugging` & `klein-bug-hunters-diary` (bug hunting),
`fowler-refactoring` (safe transforms), `khorikov-unit-testing` & `whittaker-google-testing`
(test design), `gregg-systems-performance` (observability/USE/RED). Never memorize
commands: `agf help` · `agf <cmd> --help` · `agf retrieve-command "<intent>"`.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — HUNT: collect findings deterministically (~0 token)

```bash
agf harness --violations   # 9-dim quality (types·tests·fitness·docs·naming·errors·context·provenance·connectivity)
agf gaps --severity required   # traceability, AC coverage, missing edge/error cases
agf lint   ·   agf quality   # lint + security rules + quality bars
agf insights --select data.hotspots   # churn/regression hotspots — where bugs cluster
agf provenance   # untracked/unattributed changes (audit trail gaps)
```

Multi-modal sweep — each lens is blind to the others: types (harness), behavior (gaps),
style/security (lint), history (insights/hotspots). Triangulate; don't trust one.

**Economy-integrity lenses (deterministic signals the economy pillars added — HARDEN must
consume them, they are not just dashboards).** As the token-economy machinery ships, its own
gates become audit surfaces; a stale/negative one is a real finding:

- `agf gaps --kind driver_boundary_missing` — a lever is ON but its declared driver surface
  shows **zero** economy in the ledger: wired-but-not-firing-at-the-driver, cost without return.
- `agf metrics --economy-report --select data.rd` + `agf eval --gate` — the rate-distortion
  curve: a lossy compressor whose **distortion regressed >10%** vs baseline is degrading
  meaning to save tokens. Treat a red RD gate like a failing test.
- `agf savings --by-surface` all in `unknown` — economy that is real but **not attributable to
  the driver**: the attribution wiring rotted, the number can't be trusted.
- `agf metrics --select data.fpy` cross-checked against `agf gaps --kind phantom_done` — a
  first-pass-yield near 1.0 with phantom_done findings is **inflated assertiveness**: the FPY
  reads self-reported outcomes; the triangulation is what keeps it honest.

> Command names drift — the SIGNAL is the point: lever-ON-without-driver-effect, lossy-
> compression-that-degrades-meaning, economy-not-attributable, assertiveness-inflated-by-
> unbacked-done. Confirm the live command with `agf help` / `agf retrieve-command`.

**A sixth lens — sibling-diff, found while wiring dormant code (leafcutter harvest), not
from any tool above.** When two modules implement the same concept and only one is wired,
do NOT assume the wired one is correct by default — diff them. Twice in one session the
dormant sibling turned out to encode the fix: a dormant module canonicalized a path via
`realpath` before hashing while the wired one hashed the raw string (two callers reaching
the same workspace through different symlink chains got different state dirs); a dormant
tree-sitter enrichment module read a modifier token correctly (`.text`) while the shipped
code compared the wrong field (`.type`) and silently dropped every modifier. Neither bug
had a failing test — both codebases "worked," just wrong. Whenever a WIRE-task's target
turns out to be superseded by a wired sibling, take five minutes to read the sibling's
actual logic against the dormant one before closing the finding as "superseded" — the
dormant code may be dormant _because it corrected a bug the wired copy still has_, not
because it lost a race.

### Step 2 — FILE: every finding becomes a node (traceable, honest)

```bash
agf node add --type bug  "FIX: <symptom> @ <file:line> — <repro hint>"
agf node add --type risk "SEC|QUAL|OBS: <exposure> @ <file:line> — <mitigation as AC>"
```

One node per flaw, with the **mitigation phrased as the AC** that will absorb it. No
silent fixes — if it is worth fixing, it is worth tracking (the graph is the audit log).

### Step 3 — REPRODUCE + ROOT-CAUSE (RED, scientific method)

Write the **failing test first**: the exact input that triggers the bug (or the malicious
payload for a vuln). Watch it fail — that is your proof the defect is real and the
oracle for the fix. Then **5 Whys** + **bisection** (`git bisect` / differential) to the
true cause. A regression that was passing → bisect to the breaking commit. Pin legacy
with a **characterization test** before refactoring (Feathers).

### Step 4 — FIX + OBSERVABILITY (GREEN, in one change)

Minimal change to pass the test, then **refactor** (Clean Code/SOLID) keeping green. In
the SAME change, close the observability gap that hid the bug: structured log on the
error path (`createLogger({ layer, source })`, never `console.log`), a metric/counter on
a hot path, a typed error instead of a swallowed one. Additive/opt-in stays byte-identical
for existing tests → zero regression for free.

### Step 5 — GATES: coverage ≥80% + security + quality

```bash
npm run test:blast                     # MANDATORY, standalone, green
agf tdd-score <id> --select data.score # ≥80 required; add positive+negative+edge until met
# optional robustness: agf check <id> --mutation --source <file>   # kill-ratio ≥0.60
agf harness --violations               # Clean Code/SOLID/naming/errors enforced
agf check <id>                         # DoD
```

**Security checklist (STRIDE × OWASP, run every fix):** Spoofing (authz?), Tampering
(input validated at boundary?), Repudiation (audit log?), Info-disclosure (no secret/PII
in code or error?), DoS (unbounded query/loop? add limit), Elevation (least privilege?).
Injection → parameterize; XSS → sanitize; path traversal → resolve+allowlist. Any new
exposure → a `risk` node, never a silent acceptance.

**Subprocess injection specifically:** `execSync`/`exec(`git ${args.join(' ')}`)` with
any interpolated untrusted string is a shell-injection vector even if you shell-quote
the one untrusted arg — that quoting is POSIX-specific and silently does not hold on
Windows (different metacharacters). Prefer `execFileSync(cmd, args, opts)` — it never
invokes a shell, so args reach the binary as literal argv with nothing to quote or
escape, on any platform. Live-test the fix with an actual malicious payload
(`'; touch /tmp/marker; echo '`) before and after, not just a lint pass.

**A security CLASSIFIER over a compound input is bypassable by whatever the classifier
forgot to decompose.** Earned this sweep: a bash-risk validator classified `rm`/`dd`/`chmod`
with `^`-anchored rules — so it only ever inspected the FIRST command of a chain, and
`ls; rm -rf /`, `ls && rm -rf ~`, `echo x | dd …` all came back `safe` (the destructive
command hidden after a safe prefix). Same shape as an allowlist that matches the invocation
path instead of the role: the check's premise about the INPUT'S FORM was wrong. Whenever a
detector runs a per-unit rule (`^cmd`, first-token, basename) over an input that can hold
MANY units (shell separators `; && || | &`, path segments, comma-lists, header folds),
decompose into every executable/addressable unit FIRST and classify each — return the most
severe. The free repro: feed a dangerous unit AFTER a benign one; if the verdict is benign,
the anchor is the bug. Split conservatively — over-splitting only adds checks, it can never
let a unit hide from the classifier. **The filesystem twin of this bug: prefix matching on
PATHS.** `absPath.startsWith('/tmp')` matches `/tmpevil` (sibling sharing the prefix), and a
raw absolute path that never had `..` collapsed (`/tmp/../etc/passwd`) matches a `/tmp`
sandbox while actually pointing at `/etc/passwd` — a sandbox escape to sensitive files
outside the sandbox root (e.g. `/root/...`) from a Tmpdir policy. Two fixes, both required: NORMALIZE the path first (resolve `..`/`.`,
even when it's already absolute — code often skips normalization for absolute paths), then
match with a `/` BOUNDARY (`p === base || p.startsWith(base + '/')`), never a bare prefix.
Free repro for the path case: `<allowed-root>/../etc/passwd` and `<allowed-root>evil/x` —
if either resolves to a grant, the boundary/normalization is missing. **The network twin:
domain/host allow-lists.** Matching a `*.example.com` rule with `url.includes('.example.com')`
lets `example.com.evil.com` (suffix confusion) and a marker planted in the path/query/fragment
(`evil.com/#.example.com`) pass — an SSRF-class egress bypass. PARSE the host
(`new URL(url).hostname`) and match on a label boundary (`host === domain ||
host.endsWith('.' + domain)`), never a substring of the raw URL. Free repro:
`https://<allowed-domain>.evil.com`, `https://evil.com/#<allowed-domain>`,
`https://evil.com/?x=<allowed-domain>` — any allow is a bypass. The through-line across shell,
path, and URL: **re-parse the input into its real unit (command segment / normalized path /
hostname) and match THAT with an explicit boundary — never string-search the raw input.**

**Fence/delimiter breakout — the isolation twin of the boundary class.** When untrusted
content is isolated by wrapping it between FIXED, known delimiters (a prompt fence like
`===PAGE_CONTENT_END===`, a CSV/multipart separator, a template marker), the content can
FORGE that delimiter and escape the fence — closing it early so smuggled text lands in the
trusted region (a real prompt-injection / data-injection vector). The wrapper must NEUTRALIZE
(defang/escape) every copy of the delimiter inside the payload before wrapping, so the output
holds exactly one real delimiter pair. Free repro: wrap a payload that contains the delimiter
verbatim; if the output has more than one copy of the delimiter, it breaks out. (Watch the
matching unwrap/parse too — brittle index-math around delimiters often fails even on benign
multi-line content.)

**The EXTRACTION step is its own attack surface — a gate only protects what it extracts.**
The matching classes above assume the dangerous unit already reached the validator. But a gate
that first EXTRACTS units from a compound input (paths from a command, URLs from text, args from
a line) via a narrow filter misses any unit that's disguised: a path in quotes (`rm -rf
"/etc/passwd"`), attached to a flag (`--out=/etc/x`), or a relative traversal without a leading
dot (`sub/../../etc/passwd`) all slid past a `startsWith('/'|'./'|'../')` extractor and were
never checked — a clean bypass to a denied location even though the matcher was correct.
Unwrap/normalize each token (strip quotes and `--flag=`, treat any `..` traversal as a path)
BEFORE the extraction filter. Free repro: feed the dangerous unit disguised (quoted, flag-
attached, traversal-without-prefix); if the gate allows it, the extractor is the hole, not the
matcher.

**A gate/heuristic you just added is itself a hardening target.** A newly-wired
detector (regex, path pattern, threshold) can be too broad and generate friction that
erodes trust in the DoD process — e.g. a "flag core modules needing corpus-scale
tests" pattern that matched `(^|\/)core\//i` ended up matching almost every file under
`src/core/`, forcing `--force` bypasses on legitimate work with zero true positives.
When a gate fires repeatedly on work that is clearly fine, don't just `--force` past
it every time — check whether the gate's own pattern is measurably too broad (count
false positives this session), and narrow it with a regression test proving the
narrowed pattern still catches the real case.

**The root-cause class (earned twice in one sweep): a detector that matches by LOCATION
(path/directory) instead of by ROLE (basename/content) false-positives in bulk.** A
"needs corpus-scale tests" gate keyed on `\b(parser|interpreter|…)\b` over the whole
PATH flagged every file merely living under a `parser/` directory (readers, classifiers
— not grammar parsers), and a "barrel must re-export siblings" check treated every
`index.ts` as a barrel, including bin ENTRYPOINTS (an `index.ts` opening with a shebang,
whose re-exports would run bootstrap as an import side effect). Both fixes were the same
move: match the ROLE, not the folder — test the basename / the file's own nature, and
exempt the structural exception (the shebang entrypoint). **A gate that induces `--force`
is the highest-priority hardening target of all**, because `--force` also skips the
tests — so a false-positive there doesn't just annoy, it silently punches a hole in the
quality gate every time it fires. **Measure before you narrow**: a deterministic
`git ls-files | grep` gives the real false-positive rate (e.g. 20/27 = 74% were
directory-only matches) — narrow on the datum, never on a hunch, and keep BOTH regression
assertions (the innocuous case stops firing AND the genuine case still bites).

**The lexical twin of that class: a code-pattern scanner that greps RAW source text
counts matches inside COMMENTS and STRING LITERALS.** A heuristic that flags
`catch (e) {}`, `throw new Error(`, `console.error(` by regex over `file.content`
directly will count a `catch (e) {}` sitting in a `// comment` or a `"string literal"`
as a real defect — a phantom violation no production fix can resolve (found live: an
error-handling scanner flagged the silent-failure detector because the DETECTOR'S OWN
doc-comment contained the pattern it hunts). The pattern text is code; the occurrence is
prose. Fix: strip comments and string/template literals — preserving offsets so line
numbers stay accurate — BEFORE matching, and reuse ONE shared stripper across every
sibling scanner (DRY) rather than each re-inventing it. Prove the guard still bites: a
REAL empty-catch in code must still count; only the comment/string occurrence is ignored.
Free repro: feed the scanner a file whose only match is inside a comment and inside a
string — a non-zero count is the bug.

**A silent infinite loop hides as a fast, "successful", zero-work result — root cause: a
state-machine TRANSITION gated on the WRONG SIGNAL.** A pipeline that ran maxSteps in ~2ms
with 0 output and reported a bland "resolve=0" (no error) turned out to loop one phase
forever: the "phase N is done, advance" condition checked for a node TYPE the phase's
producer never emits. A delivery machine re-ran `import` every step because "import done"
was keyed on `hasRequirements` (requirement-type nodes), but the importer for a task-only
PRD emits `task`/`acceptance_criteria` and NEVER a `requirement` — so the flag stayed false
and it never reached `implement` (0 model calls; this is exactly why a downstream ledger
read `$0`). The fix and the general rule: **a "phase-complete" / transition condition must
match what the phase's producer ACTUALLY emits (here: "any nodes exist" / `emptyGraph:false`),
not a specific artifact type it may never produce.** Second, subtler half: the loop HAD a
stall-guard (dedupe on `action|JSON.stringify(state)`), yet it never fired — because an
IRRELEVANT field in the state (a growing `totalNodes` as each re-import re-inserted) drifted
every iteration, so the guard key was never equal twice. **A stall/cycle guard keyed on the
FULL state snapshot is defeated by any drifting irrelevant field; key it on the
progress-relevant subset.** Free repro for the loop class: run the flow with a small step
cap and CAPTURE the per-step action log (a suppressed `onLog` is why this stayed invisible)
— a repeated action with an unchanging reason is the loop; the fast wall-clock + zero output
is the tell.

### Step 6 — CLOSE + LEARN

```bash
agf done <id>   ·   agf memory write pheromone-fix-<slug>   ·   agf heal
```

Deposit the root cause + the fix + the gotcha as a pheromone trail so the next hunt skips
the diagnosis you already paid for. `agf heal` clears graph noise. Then re-run Step 1 —
the loop ends only when a full sweep finds nothing required.

**At a sweep boundary, render the handoff per `_shared.md` → Close-out Report Format** —
the DELIVERY TABLE (`Entrega | O quê | Prova`, every claim graph-backed: `N testes ·
<commit>`; a still-open finding gets its own row citing the `risk`/`bug` node; sweep row
shows `test:node`/coverage) + Achado transversal + Honestidade + the decided next step
(`Próximo: X — porque [fundamento]`, e.g. risco-primeiro = severity × blast radius). Obey
that section verbatim — single source, do not re-improvise the format here.

**Skill hardening (MANDATORY close-out — `_shared.md` → Golden Rule 17):** before you hand
back, ask "what durable hardening lesson from this sweep must the NEXT woodpecker read
_here_?" A reproducible root-cause class, a new deterministic audit signal, a false-green
pattern → **edit THIS skill** (command-agnostic: the signal/why, never a hardcoded command
catalog), propagating to every synced destination (project `.agents/skills` ↔ global
`~/.claude/skills`) and scanning secrets before any public push. The sibling-diff lens and
the economy-integrity lenses above both entered this skill exactly this way. Transient facts
(counts, versions) go to memory/pheromone, never the skill.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT fix without a reproducing test — that is a guess, not a fix
- Do NOT fix the symptom — 5 Whys to the root cause, fix that
- Do NOT lower a gate (test, lint, coverage threshold) to go green — fix the code
- Do NOT raise a warning ceiling to silence a red gate — that moves the goalpost, and the
  next reader inherits a number that measures nothing
- Do NOT let a sweep (rename, codemod, find-and-replace) run over a test without proving
  the test can still fail afterwards — a rewritten assertion goes green by becoming empty
- Do NOT trust a guard whose failing run you have never seen
- Do NOT leave a failure path silent — log + metric is part of the fix
- Do NOT accept a found vulnerability without a `risk` node and a fix or explicit deferral
- Do NOT plan features or build new backlog here — that is the other two skills
- Do NOT mark done on a false claim, or below 80% coverage, or with `console.log`/`any` added

## Economy

Output is compressed automatically with `--ai`; project with `--select <path>`; recover
the exact command with `agf retrieve-command "<intenção>"`; reuse before you create.
Opt-in levers via `agf economy on <lever>` (`ncd_dedup`, `mdl_select`, `info_bottleneck`…);
measure with `agf metrics --economy-report` and `agf savings`. Route by cost with
`agf provider use <id>` + `agf model`/`--pin` (cheap model for mechanical fixes, frontier
only for hard root-cause). Hunting (Step 1) is deterministic and ~0 token by design.

See `_shared.md` → **Token Economy** for the full arsenal: gateway auto-levers
(diff-edits, repo-map, lossy-gate, CCR), `agf economy list`, and the compress guardrail.
