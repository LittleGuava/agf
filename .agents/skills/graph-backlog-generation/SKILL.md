# graph-backlog-generation

The planner. One faceted, human-in-the-loop chain that turns a vague idea (or the
project's own findings) into a **complete PRD injected as graph backlog** — epics,
tasks, and testable AC — so a separate agent (`graph-builder-leafcutter`) only
implements. Plans only; never writes production code.

## ⛔ Hard rule — PLAN ONLY, zero code (read this first)

When this skill is invoked you **cannot write code**. Not a stub, not a test, not a
one-line edit, not "just to verify a shape". The **only** artifacts you produce are

> **Jurisprudência desta etapa** (casos reais + o blind-spot que os produziu): [references/field-lessons.md](references/field-lessons.md) → seção "⛔ Hard rule — PLAN ONLY, zero code (read this first)". Carregue sob demanda.

The planner also **never touches git**: no `commit`, no new/switched branch. The
backlog lives in the shared, gitignored `workflow-graph/graph.db` — it persists across
branches, so stay where you are. Branch-per-implementation is the builder's job.

## When to Use

- Start of any cycle: a vague idea, a new feature, or "what should we build next?"
- Backlog is empty / stale, or a cycle just shipped (iterate the next from findings)
- You have a PRD to import and structure into the graph
- You explicitly want planning/PRD/AC work — NOT implementation (that's the builder)

Do NOT use when an unblocked task already exists and you just need to code → use
`graph-builder-leafcutter`.

## Deterministic plan (low-reasoning fast-path)

If you are a low-reasoning model (Haiku, DeepSeek Flash, MiniMax, etc.), follow THIS —
the framework names used later (Cynefin, WSJF, MoSCoW, INVEST…) are expanded here as
plain rules, so you never need to know them. **PLAN ONLY: emit graph nodes + text,
never code/git.** Top to bottom, obey every **STOP**/**DEFAULT**.

1. `agf preflight "<theme>"` → verdict `wip-conflict`/`duplicate-risk` on **another**
   epic → **STOP**, report (someone already owns it). Else continue.
2. `agf exec chain "stats --select data.byStatus; gaps --severity required"` (1 round-trip,
   sem shell `&&`) → is there already ready backlog? **Yes → STOP**: tell the user to run
   `graph-builder-leafcutter`.
3. Frame in one line each (no jargon): **WHO** needs it · **WHAT** changes for them ·
   **WHY** (one measurable win). Uncertainty rule: you can see how to build it → write
   tasks now; you cannot → add ONE `risk` node `spike: investigate <X>` and stop on that area.
4. `agf generate-prd "<idea>"` (or `agf import-prd <file>`).
5. Per epic: `agf node add --type epic …` with **Objective + 1 measurable Key Result**
   in the description (a number/percent/latency — not "improve X").
6. `agf decompose`. **Slice outside-in from the surface the user operates** (web → the
   frontend screen; agf → the CLI command; API → the endpoint). Every leaf ≤2h and
   self-sufficient:
   - each leaf = **ONE control on that surface proven end-to-end** (button/field/screen),
     not a backend layer — e.g. "the _Run_ button on the rules screen returns true/false",
     not "build the rule engine"
   - backend/data work is only a leaf wired `depends_on` a surface AC that fails without
     it — pull it, never plan it top-down
   - title `IMPLEMENT:|WIRE:|FIX:|DOCS: <one outcome>`
   - description: the WHY + **exact file paths** to touch (`src/…`) + "do not recreate"
   - 2–4 `--ac` lines, each **Given-When-Then** with a concrete number/boolean/string,
     observable at the surface (números batem / estado renderizado / true|false)
   - the exact test file `src/tests/<stem>.test.ts`
7. Priority tag — use this table, no judgement:

   | situation                       | tag      |
   | ------------------------------- | -------- |
   | breaks/blocks others without it | `must`   |
   | clear value, not blocking       | `should` |
   | nice-to-have                    | `could`  |

   Order within `must`: blocks-most-others first; tie → smallest job.

8. `agf gaps --severity required --json` → for each gap run its `applyVia` → repeat until
   `ready: true`.
9. `agf check <each task id>` → AC score <60 → rewrite the AC concretely (add the missing
   number/fixture), retry.
10. **Completeness critic — NOT optional. Run a COMMAND for each, never just think.** A
    finding with no tool output behind it is invented — discard it. A "no" becomes a node:
    - a. Write the flow `A → B → C → …`. Does **every arrow** have an owning epic? (An
      arrow with no owner is a missing epic — that is how a backlog looks complete and isn't.)
    - b. `node show` each contract → can **each consumer** do its job with ONLY those fields?
      (A target/id/budget nobody carries is the classic hole; no gate sees it.)
    - c. For each promise in a milestone/KR → which task **produces** it? (grep it.)
    - d. `ls` the module you're extending → which files did you **never open**? `grep -rn`
      each exported symbol → any with no caller that you're about to duplicate?
    - e. Query the graph per axis: security · credentials · wall-clock timeout · logging ·
      concurrency · reproducibility. Owned, or deferred **with a node**?
    - f. Could a KR go green **without** the value? (Then the KR is the defect.)
    - g. What is the laziest wrong implementation that still passes? (→ AC or `risk`.)
      Includes: does any metric prove its own instrument is plugged in?
11. **STOP for the human:** "backlog ready, N tasks, critic swept with evidence (findings: …)
    — run `graph-builder-leafcutter`."

**Never:** write/edit code, create/switch a git branch or commit, or inject a task whose
AC has no concrete, checkable value.

## Golden Rules (planner edition)

> The full universal set lives in `_shared.md` → **Golden Rules (universal
> engineering)** — obey it verbatim; the list below is the planner-specific slice.
> Each planning handoff MUST follow `_shared.md` → **Close-out Report Format**
> (what was injected + proof + `Próximo: X — porque [fundamento]`).

The project's golden rules, distilled for ANALYZE/DESIGN/PLAN. Non-negotiable:

1. **Investigate first, never duplicate.** `agf preflight "<theme>"` + scan existing
   epics + a repomix code-map BEFORE planning. A `wip-conflict` / `duplicate-risk`
   verdict = STOP; another agent or a shipped epic already owns it.
2. **Expand, never recreate (DRY) — and point at the WIRED module, not a legacy
   twin.** search/query/grep/repomix for the owning module and plan to _extend_ it.
   Net-new only when it provably does not exist — the strongest epics wire dormant/
   partial code that already lives in the repo. **Trap: two files can share the same
   stem** (a legacy `core/llm/tier-router.ts` beside the live `model-hub/tier-router.ts`);
   a task whose EXPAND-pointer names the dead twin makes the builder edit the wrong
   file. Before you write a file path into a task, `grep -rn` its consumers and name
   the one that is actually _imported by the live path_ — code wins the plan.
3. **Graph is the source of truth.** No task without a node; code/graph beat
   memory/plan (counts in memories go stale — reconcile with `agf stats`/`query`).
4. **Dogfood.** Drive the whole cycle with `agf` itself; in-repo use `npm run dev --
<cmd>`, never the stale installed binary.
5. **Distill to atomic.** Every leaf ≤2h, INVEST-Small, GWT-testable AC; one
   responsibility per node; decompose oversize into subtasks; WIP=1 (pull, don't push).
6. **Quality as AC, not prose.** Clean Code · SOLID · KISS · YAGNI encoded as testable
   constraints (file <800, fn <50, 1 responsibility, immutability, no `any`, typed errors).
7. **Plan only.** Never implement/test/review here — hand the backlog to the builder.

## Mandatory Flow

This chain is a **Generator–Critic (Reflection) loop**, not a straight line: the injection
half generates, Step 5.5 attacks it with tools, findings become nodes, repeat until the
critic comes back empty **with evidence**.

```
        ┌──────────────────────── GENERATOR ────────────────────────┐
[investigate graph + git + code → find WHITE SPACE] → (checkpoint human on direction)
  → generate-prd / import-prd → decompose → node add + edge add (epics·tasks·AC)
  → gaps (close required) → validate AC (agf check) → verify tree
        └───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                                    ▼
            COMPLETENESS CRITIC (Step 5.5 — 7 tool-grounded sweeps)
                     findings → nodes ──┐
                                    ▲   │ (loop until empty, with evidence)
                                    └───┘
                                    ▼
                          STOP for human ⇆ next cycle
```

The critic is **mandatory and self-triggered**. A human asking "did anything get left out?"
means the loop never closed — that pass must run before they ever see the backlog.

The chain ends by **stopping for the human** with a complete PRD in the graph. It
never enters IMPLEMENT — it hands the backlog to the builder.

> `agf help` — so this skill never goes stale when commands are added or renamed.

### Step 1 — Investigate & find white space (dogfood)

Read the project's real state across **three surfaces**, not just the graph:

**Surface A — the graph & process state:**

```bash
agf preflight "<theme>"                  # WIP/dedupe/branch guard — is another agent already on this?
agf stats · agf insights bottlenecks · agf harness --violations · agf gaps --severity required
agf query --type epic --status backlog   # what's ALREADY planned — do not re-plan it
```

**Surface B — the codebase, via Repomix (deterministic, ~0 LLM tokens to produce).**
The point is to understand the project **without reading all of it** — extract signal,
then drill into the one area that matters. The 3 cheap passes:

```bash
repomix --no-files --token-count-tree 200            # SHAPE: dir tree + per-file token counts → complexity/debt HOTSPOTS
repomix --compress --remove-comments --stdout --include "src/**"  # STRUCTURE: Tree-sitter skeleton (no bodies) → API surface to EXPAND
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs --stdout      # MOTION: uncommitted WIP (other agents) + recent churn/trajectory
```

Read the map for **strong vs weak areas**: weak = oversized files (>800 lines),
git-churn hotspots (default sort is most-changed-first = bug-prone), missing
tests/error-paths in the compressed structure; dormant = exported-but-unwired symbols
(best EXPAND targets); strong = small + low-churn + tested → leave alone (Lean). Secret
scan is on by default; never use `--no-security-check`.

> **Full repomix catalog** (scope/git/output-shaping/remote/MCP `grep_repomix_output`):
> [references/repomix-investigation.md](references/repomix-investigation.md). Always
> `repomix --help` for the live flags. **Repomix is an optional external tool** — where
> it is not installed, fall back to Surface A (`agf` graph-map) + `agf search` / `grep -rn`
> over `src`; the investigation still completes, just less compressed.

The deliverable of this step is **white space**: value that is real, grounded in
findings, and NOT already covered by an existing epic or in-flight by another epic.
A backlog of 1000+ nodes is normal — the planner's hardest job is _not adding
duplicates_. Prefer wiring dormant/partial code over net-new (golden rule); the
strongest epics come from code that existed but was unwired.

```bash
agf query --type task --status blocked --select 'data[].{id,description}'
```

Group what you find by finding-shape, not by reading each node cold:

- **Half an epic** (mechanism ready, no consumer built) → usually a real, scopeable
  epic on its own: decompose the missing consumer as tasks with AC.
- **Systemic scaffolded family** (N files, same shape, one root cause) → **one**
  epic/decision covering all N, never N separate tasks — the builder already named
  the whole family in one of the blocked nodes; don't re-derive it file by file.
- **Overlaps an already-wired system** → usually NOT an epic; either retire the
  dormant module (a `task` to delete it) or scope a narrow task for just the
  non-overlapping differentiator the finding already named.
- **Superseded by a sibling** → usually a cleanup task (retire the loser), not a
  feature epic — verify the finding's claim (`agf harness --dormant`) before trusting
  it blind, since a stale finding may have been fixed since.

A blocked node with no finding text (just the harvest boilerplate, never triaged) is
still raw signal — treat it like an untriaged repomix hotspot, not pre-digested.

### Step 2 — Frame the problem & confirm direction

Apply 5W2H + JTBD to state the problem; Cynefin to size uncertainty; Pareto to pick
the 20% scope that delivers 80% value. **Impact Mapping** anchors it on the goal:
`Goal (Why, measurable) → Actors (Who) → Impacts (How behavior changes) → Deliverables
(What)` — each candidate epic must trace back to one goal through an impact, and each
epic carries an **OKR-style measurable outcome** (Objective + ≥1 Key Result) so it
ships outcome, not just output. Order the Pareto-selected Must/Should set by **WSJF**
(Cost of Delay ÷ Job Size) to sequence biggest-value-soonest. See references.

> **Jurisprudência desta etapa** (casos reais + o blind-spot que os produziu): [references/field-lessons.md](references/field-lessons.md) → seção "Step 2 — Frame the problem & confirm direction". Carregue sob demanda.

### Step 3 — Generate / import the PRD

```bash
agf generate-prd "<idea>"        # LLM draft from a prompt
agf import-prd <file> [--build-tree]   # import an existing/edited PRD → graph
```

PRD covers: vision · problem · objectives · architecture · functional reqs ·
NFRs (perf/security/a11y as measurable AC) · risk matrix.

Organize epics along a **User Story Map backbone** (journey steps left→right) and
commit only the **walking-skeleton / MVP release slice** this cycle — the thinnest
end-to-end runnable path (Pareto + JIT). Deeper stories stay as deferred
`should`/`could` epics for the next cycle to pull without re-planning.

#### Slice CONSUMER-SURFACE-FIRST (outside-in) — the DEFAULT decomposition axis

agf is a factory that generates **N different apps** depending on what the dev drives it
toward. Whatever the app, the backbone starts where the **user actually operates** the
product, and every slice must PROVE itself there. The surface differs per app; the axis
is the same:

| app kind         | consumer surface = where you slice first                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| web / admin      | **the screen + its controls** (a route, its buttons/fields/tables) — the primary case |
| CLI (agf itself) | the **command** (`agf <cmd>` output)                                                  |
| API / service    | the **endpoint** (request → response)                                                 |

> **Por que outside-in vence** (Walking Skeleton de Cockburn, GOOS, OKR, estigmergia/ACO, Little's Law): [references/field-lessons.md](references/field-lessons.md) → "Fundações do outside-in". A regra está acima; a fundamentação é consulta.

**How it lands in the graph:**

- **Each leaf = ONE control on the surface, proven end-to-end.** Not "build the rules
  service" but "the _Run_ button on the rules screen evaluates and renders true/false" — the
  whole vertical (control → API → domain logic → store → rendered result) for that one
  control, wired and clicking.
- **Backend/data work is PULLED, never pushed.** Do NOT plan a backend epic top-down. A
  backend task exists only as a leaf wired `depends_on` a **surface AC that fails without
  it** — the failing surface operation is what justifies the descent. Every inner node stays
  traceable to a control the user can see.
- **The epic's Key Result is the surface operating whole**, observable at the surface: _"the
  batch screen processes a real batch — the totals reconcile, eligible vs non-eligible each
  carry a reason, and export/upload/bulk-insert are all wired and clickable"_ — a number + a
  boolean + a rendered state, never "it works". A control on the screen with no leaf that
  proves it = incomplete epic (the arrow/seam sweep, applied to UI controls).
- **Order:** a screen's controls become sibling leaves; a control another depends on (create
  the record **before** you run it) gets a `depends_on` edge. Screens order left→right along
  the journey — unless a screen must exist first because others read what it configures
  (a rules screen sits **above** the flow that consumes those rules).

### Step 4 — Structure as graph + decompose to atomic tasks

```bash
agf node add --type epic|requirement   ·   agf edge add <from> <to> --type <rel>
agf decompose                          # large tasks → atomic (≤2h) subtasks
```

Each task gets MoSCoW priority + INVEST-scored, Given-When-Then **testable AC**
(multiple discrete `--ac` entries — never one prose blob). Derive the AC by **Example
Mapping**: list the story's **Rules** → one concrete **Example** per rule becomes one
GWT `--ac` (with its fixture); open **Questions** become `risk` nodes, never
silent gaps. A rule with no example is untestable — don't inject it. Split oversized
stories with **SPIDR** (Spike · Paths · Interfaces · Data · Rules) alongside the
distillation heuristics. TDD/SOLID/security expressed as AC, not prose.

#### The task-node contract (what makes a leaf buildable)

Every leaf the builder pulls must be self-sufficient — if it would have to
re-investigate the codebase to start, the node isn't done. **Epic nodes** carry the
**Objective + Key Result** (the success metric) in their description/AC; leaves carry:

- **Title** — imperative verb prefix signalling work type: `WIRE:` `IMPLEMENT:`
  `RELEASE:` `FIX:` `DOCS:`. One atomic outcome (≤2h).
- **Description** — the _why_ + exact EXPAND pointers: the real file paths and symbols
  the executor must touch in **your** repository, and an explicit "do not recreate".
  **Trap: spell each path out — never a brace-glob shorthand.** Writing
  `src/cli/commands/{init,start,doctor}-cmd.ts` in a description trips the
  `phantom_pointer` gap: the detector reads the whole glob as ONE nonexistent file and
  flags the node (and misleads the builder into hunting a path that isn't there). List
  the three real paths separately (`…/init-cmd.ts, …/start-cmd.ts, …/doctor-cmd.ts`).
  **Same trap, second shape: never let a path be immediately followed by a colon.**
  Prose like `EXPAND src/cli.ts: the command switch lives here` makes the detector read
  `src/cli.ts:` (colon included) as the filename — the file exists, the pointer is what's
  malformed. Write `EXPAND the file src/cli.ts — the command switch…` instead, and keep
  line references in separate words (`lines 337-386`), never glued as `path.ts:337`.
  Both shapes are **class (a) obsolete/malformed pointer**, not a missing artifact: fix
  the pointer, never re-aim the node at a plausible neighbour to silence the gate.
- **AC** — 2–4 discrete `--ac` Given-When-Then criteria, each independently testable
  with a concrete fixture (`new Database(':memory:')`, stub-LLM token counter). Make
  them **observable**: a number, a boolean, a status code, an exact string. Weak
  phrasing with no threshold trips `has_testable_ac` — put the concrete value in the AC.
- **Contract pointer** — name the boundary's `contract` node (see enrichment layer) so
  the leaf carries the exact shape, not a vague "returns JSON".
- **Test file** — the exact `src/tests/<stem>.test.ts` path + the fixture to use, so the
  builder writes the RED test without re-deriving it.
- **Tags** — MoSCoW (`must|should|could`) + theme; tags become ACO trails for the builder.
- **Edges** — `depends_on` to any sibling that must land first (encodes build order).

#### Backlog enrichment layer (what a _light_ model needs to ship effortlessly)

A buildable epic is more than tasks + AC. Inject the supporting nodes a junior/light
model would otherwise have to infer — each with the right **type** and **edge
semantics**. This is the difference between "a list of tasks" and "implementable with
zero re-investigation":

| Node type                | Carries                                                                                                              | Wire with                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `contract` / `interface` | the **exact** request/return shape **+ the source of each field** (which existing helper to reuse, with `file:line`) | task `implements` → contract; consumer `consumes` → contract |
| `risk`                   | the failure mode **+ its mitigation phrased as the AC that absorbs it**                                              | risk `related_to` the task(s) it threatens                   |
| `constraint`             | global guardrails — zero-deps, file <800, fn <50, no `any`, layer boundary, read-only                                | `parent_of` the epic                                         |
| `requirement` / NFR      | perf · security · a11y as measurable criteria                                                                        | **a task must `implements` it** (see the trap in Step 5)     |
| `performance_budget`     | a concrete budget (e.g. fluid ≤300 nodes, poll ≤2s)                                                                  | `related_to` the affected task                               |

The `contract` node is the highest-leverage artifact — for every API/module boundary,
give the exact TS shape and where each value comes from (`summarizeLedger(...).totals`
at `file:line`), so a cheap model fills the body without exploring. Every Example-Map
**Question**/**risk** becomes a node, never a silent gap; the mitigation you write on
the risk reappears as a concrete AC on the owning task (traceable via `related_to`).

#### Spec-driven layer (opt-in, raises rigor without code)

Maximise agf's planning surface — all still PLAN-only, zero code:

```bash
agf constitution                 # governing principles — indexed, enforced at every gate
agf preset --apply <name>        # default | strict-tdd | agile-light | enterprise
agf spec --generate <template>   # phase spec for a high-stakes epic
agf spec-sync link <specId> <nodeId>   # bind the living spec to its graph node
```

Encode the non-negotiables (immutability, no `any`, layer boundaries) **once** in the
`agf constitution` instead of repeating them per task — gates validate against it. For a
high-stakes epic, generate a phase spec and `spec-sync link` it to the node so spec and
graph never drift. `agf preset` sets the cycle's workflow rigor up front.

### Step 5 — Close gaps & validate

```bash
agf gaps --severity required          # close every required gap (traceability, AC coverage)
agf check <taskId>                    # per-task DoD; the planner bar is AC-present + AC-score ≥ 60

On the same fresh backlog, `consumer_proof` and `no_unresolved_blockers` also fail by
construction — nothing is built and the deps don't exist yet. Read the DoD's own
`ac_quality_pass` line (it prints the score against its minimum) as the planner's real
signal; the aggregate `ready:false` is about the builder's future, not your tree.

#### Completeness-Critic gate (MANDATORY — run it yourself, never wait to be asked)

This gate is the **Reflection / Generator-Critic** pattern (a.k.a. CRITIC) made
mandatory: the same failure mode — a backlog that looks done and isn't — is what
Reflection exists to kill, by **separating generation from evaluation**. You already
played the _generator_ (injected the epics/tasks). Now **switch roles and become an
adversarial critic** whose only job is to prove the backlog INCOMPLETE. This is a
distinct pass in the _same_ loop — a change of posture and a fresh evaluation against
rigid criteria, **not** a spawned sub-agent (no fan-out; golden rule 13). Run it as a
tight cycle: **Generate → Critique → Revise → re-Critique** until the critic returns
zero open holes; only then stop for the human.

The critic's stance is **assume-incomplete-until-proven**. Do not ask "is this done?"
(the generator always answers yes). Ask "what is MISSING that would block a builder?"
and **force yourself to emit the list explicitly** — every missing risk, dependency,
seam, driver, or surface — _before_ concluding, reasoning end-to-end (chain-of-thought
over the value flow, not a glance at the node count). An empty critic list is only
credible after the six lenses below have each been answered out loud; "I looked and it's
fine" is the generator talking, not the critic.

The DoD sweep proves the nodes that EXIST are well-formed. It says nothing about the
nodes that SHOULD exist and don't. That is the hole a human keeps catching by feel —
and "the human noticed" is not a process (golden rule 8: the trigger must be the
method, not someone remembering). So **before** you stop for the human, run these six
lenses over the whole injected backlog yourself, out loud in the close-out. Each is a
question that has caught a real missing node; a "no" answer is a node to add (or a
`risk` to park). Report the sweep result — `Completeness sweep: 6 lenses, N holes
found + closed` — so the human never has to ask "algo mais?".

1. **Value-chain walk — arrows AND seams.** Write the theme's end-to-end flow as an
   explicit chain and name the owner of every **arrow** (a stage) _and_ every **seam**
   (the data contract crossing between two stages). Unowned arrow → missing task;
   unowned seam → missing `contract` node. (The "WALK IT" guidance in Step 3 is this
   lens for arrows; the seam half is just as load-bearing — two epics can each be
   complete while nobody owns the record-shape that passes between them.)
   **Aggregator-without-producer — the seam's most expensive shape.** When the theme is
   "prove/aggregate/score X" (a verdict fusing N signals into one confidence), the
   generator blind-spot is shipping the READER of each signal but not its PRODUCER. It
   looks complete because on the happy path the signals are green — but the signal that
   is usually EMPTY (a consumer-proof, an outcome, an attestation nobody records) has no
   task that FILLS it, so the verdict is structurally stuck at its incomplete band and
   the "means" are never legible. For every pillar an aggregation epic reads, name the
   task that PRODUCES it (grep the writer); a pillar with a reader and no producer is an
   unowned seam. And when the theme is "make the means explicit," the contract must carry
   a per-signal `rationale`/why field — otherwise the explain surface invents it.
2. **Set-coverage.** Any gate/router/activation keyed on evidence must produce evidence
   for **every** unit it can act on, not just the flagship (see the measure→activate
   anti-pattern). Measure 1 of N → the gate defaults 1 of N.
3. **Consumer-surface matrix.** For every "prove value" claim, is it proven in **each**
   surface the project ships — CLI · web/dashboard · CI-gate? A value proven only in the
   CLI leaves the web (and the gate) consumer blind; that is a missing `COBRAR(<surface>)`
   task, one per surface the theme touches.
4. **Claim-staleness / reconciliation.** Does any change flip a claim asserted
   elsewhere — generated docs (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md), memory, a **CI baseline**, a default
   flag? Every flipped claim needs a reconciliation owner (a `DOCS:` or rebaseline task).
   A default that changes from OFF→ON silently turns three things stale: the doc that
   says "OFF", the regression baseline that priced "OFF", and the memory that recorded it.
5. **Foundational-driver exists?** Any task that assumes a harness / suite / fixture /
   runner — verify that thing **exists in the repo** (`ls`/`grep`), don't assume. A gate
   that references a suite dir that was never created, or a measurement that "runs via" a
   driver nobody built, is a missing foundational task the rest silently depends on.
6. **Latent-inventory triple.** Enumerate every latent capability the theme names, then
   check each has all three: **measured** ∧ **wired** ∧ **charged**. A capability with a
   wire but no measurement (or a measurement but no consumer-surface charge) is still
   value leaking — the theme is "activate the latent", so partial coverage is the defect.

### Step 5.5 — Completeness critic (MANDATORY, tool-grounded — never hand over an uncriticised backlog)

This step is the **Critic half of a Generator–Critic (Reflection) loop**: Steps 1–5 generate,
this step attacks what they produced, findings become nodes, repeat. It is **not optional and
never human-triggered**. If someone has to ask "did anything get left out?", the skill already
failed — their intuition is not a control. `gaps`, DoR and `check` score **the nodes that
exist**; nothing scores **the node you never wrote**. This is that missing scorer.

So: **a sweep is not a thought, it is a command.** Each finding below must name the tool
output that produced it — a `grep` hit, a file you opened, a `node show`, a graph query. A
finding with no external evidence is hallucinated critique and must be discarded, not
injected. A sweep that "looks fine on reflection" was not run. This is the same principle as
golden rule 8 (enforcement = deterministic trigger, not an agent remembering), applied to
critique itself: the critic must be grounded in something outside the model.

Run **all seven** before Step 6, every cycle, and report the result — including "swept,
nothing found". Each sweep pairs a question with the tool that answers it:

| #   | Sweep                      | The question                                                                                                                        | Grounded by                                                                                                                         |
| --- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Arrows, not boxes**      | Write the flow `A → B → C`. Does **every arrow** have an owning epic?                                                               | graph query per stage; an arrow with no owner = missing epic                                                                        |
| 2   | **Contract sufficiency**   | For each `contract`, can **each consumer** do its job with ONLY those fields?                                                       | `node show` the contract; list consumers; a field everyone needs and nobody carries (target, id, budget) is invisible to every gate |
| 3   | **Promise ownership**      | For each claim in a milestone/KR: which task **produces** it?                                                                       | grep the milestone text; search tasks per promise. A promise with no producer is the thing you'd report as delivered                |
| 4   | **Modality not run**       | Which files of the module you extend did you **never open**? Any exported-but-uncalled symbol you're about to duplicate?            | `ls` the module, `grep -rn` each symbol's callers. Unread file = unverified DRY claim                                               |
| 5   | **NFR axes**               | Owned or _consciously deferred with a node_: security · credentials · wall-clock timeout · logging · concurrency · reproducibility? | graph query per axis. "Nobody thought about it" is not deferral                                                                     |
| 6   | **Goodhart**               | Could a KR go green **without** delivering the value?                                                                               | read each KR against a plausible trivial implementation — the outcome-level twin of a weak AC                                       |
| 7   | **Failure-mode inversion** | What is the **laziest wrong implementation that still passes**?                                                                     | read each AC set adversarially → the answer is a missing AC or a `risk`                                                             |

Sweep 7 has a special case worth naming: **instruments lie by omission.** A ledger reports
`cost == 0` just as happily when nobody wired the counter as when nothing was spent. Any KR
measured by your own instrument needs an AC proving the instrument **moves** (inject a fake
cost → the counter must rise). Otherwise the metric proves only that it is unplugged.

Sweep 5's blind-spot, earned the hard way: **a read-only happy path hides who owns the write.**
When an epic explores, crawls, or drives a system it did not author, the generator plans the
reading and never plans the _acting_ — because every example it imagined was a read. Nothing in
the tree is malformed; the gates go green; and the first real run mutates or destroys state
nobody authorized. Worse, any epic that _persists what worked_ (a pheromone map, a cached
skill, a learned path) turns one successful destructive action into a reinforced one, repeated
every run after. So: for any epic that acts on a system it does not own, ask who classifies the
action **before** it executes, and make the unclassified case BLOCK rather than proceed —
a permissive default on an unrecognized action is the failure mode, not the recognized
destructive one. Pair it with sweep 5's other half: grep the graph's existing `constraint`
nodes against your NEW tasks. A task that casually proposes a third-party library or a new
surface can contradict a global constraint that has been in the graph for cycles; the constraint
is invisible to the task's own gates, so only the critic catches it.

Sweep 7's twin, earned the hard way: **evidence lies by provenance.** An oracle that keys on
_absence_ of evidence (`data is None → inconclusive`) is structurally blind to _evidence from
the wrong source_ — which is the likelier failure. The generator blind-spot: a target contract
that carries WHERE to go (`url`) but makes proving-you-arrived optional (`ready_probe: Probe|None`)
looks complete, because on the happy path you always land on the right page. Then reality
redirects — an auth wall, a consent gate, an error page, a stale SPA route — and the wrong page
loads _perfectly_: HTTP 200, a valid read, a plausible number (usually 0). That number becomes a
false `fail` (the system never broke; the test never arrived), or a false `pass` when the KR
happens to expect 0. Every gate stays green because every node is well-formed. So: **any node
that reads a value from somewhere must carry the provenance of that read, and identity of the
source is asserted BEFORE the value is compared.** When you write a contract with an optional
validate/identity field, ask what loads successfully when you're in the wrong place.

Findings are not prose — each becomes a node (task · contract update · risk · ADR) or an
explicitly recorded deferral. Then re-run `gaps` and re-sweep. **Report every finding to the
human with its evidence**, so the critique is auditable rather than trusted.

### Step 6 — Stop for the human ⇆ iterate (the loop)

When the PRD is complete and DoR passes, **STOP and present it** for the **Three Amigos
sign-off** — the human (Product + Test) may interrupt, adjust scope, or approve. On
approval, the next cycle re-enters Step 1, seeded by the freshly-updated project
findings (continuous dogfood evolution).

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT write code, tests, or stubs, and do NOT touch git (no commit, no new/switched
  branch) — the deliverable is graph nodes; implementation + branch-per-feature is the
  builder's. If you opened an editor, you left the planner — revert and node-ify it.
- Do NOT hand over a backlog whose completeness critic (Step 5.5) never ran. If the human has
  to ask "did anything get left out?", the skill failed. Report the sweep every cycle — even
  when it finds nothing.
- Do NOT critique by introspection — "let me re-read my plan and see if it's complete" is
  **intrinsic** self-correction, which measurably makes output WORSE (Huang et al. 2023);
  every sweep must cite a tool result (grep/file/graph), per CRITIC (Gou et al. 2023).
- Do NOT mistake green gates for completeness. `gaps`, DoR and `check` score the nodes that
  EXIST; none can see the epic you never wrote. A fully green tree with a missing stage is
  the normal way this fails.
- Do NOT chase global `agf gaps` debt — filter to your own node ids; only your subtree
  must be required-clean. **But validate the filter before you believe a zero.** On a
  saturated backlog the gap list is long and **`--limit` silently truncates it**, so your
  subtree's gaps can sit past the cut and you report "0 gaps" for a tree that has 35. Two
  cheap checks make the instrument trustworthy: raise the limit until the _total_ count
  stops changing, and confirm at least one of your own node ids appears somewhere in the
  raw list before filtering. A hand-rolled filter that returns 0 on the first try is a
  suspect, not a result — earned the hard way, twice in one session
- Do NOT add a `requirement`/NFR/`contract` node without wiring a task that `implements`
  it — that creates a phantom required gap
- Do NOT `node rm` + re-add just to fix AC — `node update --ac "<c1>" "<c2>" …` REPLACES
  the whole `ac[]` in place (repeatable; pass every criterion you want to keep) and
  preserves all edges; enrich prose via `--description`
- Do NOT implement, test, or review here — that is `graph-builder-leafcutter`
- Do NOT emit one run-on AC — use multiple discrete, testable Given-When-Then criteria
- Do NOT skip the investigate step — the backlog must be grounded in real findings
- Do NOT over-produce (Lean): plan only the Pareto-justified scope per cycle. When the
  backlog is already saturated, scan existing epics first (`agf query --type epic
--status backlog`) and **EXPAND/wire dormant code rather than recreate** — confirm
  white space with the human before injecting overlapping epics
- Do NOT hardcode a gate phase or flag that may not exist — verify with `--help` first
- Do NOT treat a failing `status_flow_valid` on fresh backlog as a defect — it is
  expected; the planner bar is AC-present + AC-score ≥ 60
- Do NOT ship an epic with tasks but no measurable outcome/KR — that is output blind to
  outcome; give every epic an Objective + Key Result
- Do NOT plan a backend/data epic top-down. Slice **outside-in from the consumer surface**
  (screen/command/endpoint the user operates); a backend leaf exists only wired
  `depends_on` a **surface AC that fails without it** — pull it, never push it. A backend
  node with no surface control tracing back to it is speculative work (Walking Skeleton /
  GOOS outside-in TDD) and inflates time-to-market for zero observable value
- Do NOT frame a KR as an inner artifact ("the service exists", "the parser is done"). The
  KR is the **surface operating whole**, observed in the consumer's mode — a number, a
  boolean, a rendered state (`_shared.md` Golden Rule 16). A control on the screen with no
  leaf that proves it end-to-end = incomplete epic
- Do NOT let a **measure→activate** pair measure only the flagship unit. When an epic
  gates activation on evidence (smart-defaults, auto-tuning, a router that flips a
  behaviour per item), the paired measurement task must produce evidence for **every**
  unit the gate can flip — not just the one you started with. Measure 1 of N and the
  gate can only ever default that 1; the other N−1 stay dark. Budget one measurement
  leaf covering the whole activatable set (or a loop over it), wired `depends_on` before
  the gate.
- Do NOT call a story "ready" with rules but no examples, or with unresolved Example-Map
  questions — convert each to a `risk` node or send it back to DESIGN

## Graph mechanics (CLI contract)

- **Parent/child:** `agf node add --parent <id>` sets `parentId` directly (one call) —
  no separate containment edge needed. `agf query --parent <id>` does **not** reliably
  list children; verify structure via each child's `parentId` (from `agf node show`).
- **AC at creation:** pass repeatable `--ac "<Given… When… Then…>"`. `import-prd` and
  `generate-prd` extract AC from the PRD markdown and synthesize testable Given-When-Then
  criteria for tasks that lack them — the output envelope includes `data.acCoverage` with
  per-task coverage. Use `node add --ac` to add or refine ACs after import.
- **Dependencies:** `agf edge add <from> <to> --type depends_on` to enforce build order
  inside an epic (e.g. release-task depends_on the wiring-task).
- **`edge add` is POSITIONAL:** `agf edge add <from> <to> --type <rel>` — there is **no**
  `--from/--to` (passing them silently no-ops). Relations you'll use: `depends_on`,
  `parent_of`, `implements` (task→requirement/contract), `consumes` (consumer→contract),
  `related_to` (risk/perf→task). Confirm the live set with `agf edge add --help`.
- **AC is revisable in place (NOT write-once).** `node update --ac "<c1>" "<c2>" …` is
  repeatable and **REPLACES** the node's whole `ac[]` — it does **not** append, so to
  revise AC pass the COMPLETE set (the criteria you keep + the new ones). Edges are
  preserved — **never `node rm` + re-add just to fix AC** (that needlessly re-wires every
  edge; earned the hard way — a 5-task epic was rebuilt before this flag was noticed).
  `node update --description` edits the prose independently.
- **Status is forward-only — planner never sets `in_progress`.** Leave tasks in
  `backlog` (or `ready` once DoR passes). `in_progress`/`done` are the builder pulling.
  If a node slipped to `in_progress`, valid transitions are `done|blocked|ready|`
  `quarantined` — you **cannot** go back to `backlog`; set it `ready`.

## Token Economy

Output is auto-compressed with `--ai`; no manual flags needed. Levers:

- **`--select <path>`** — shape every read down to the field you need (output→input lean).
- **`agf retrieve-command "<intent>"`** (RAG-IN) — the exact current command, no guessing.
- **`agf montar-output "<objetivo>"`** (RAG-OUT) — reuse PRD scaffolds instead of re-drafting.
- **`agf savings` / `agf metrics`** — the ledger logs token economy automatically.

See `_shared.md` for the full arsenal.

## Pilot Protocol

Planning chain is human-in-the-loop, not autonomous. The build/execute loop
(next→brief→submit) lives in `graph-builder-leafcutter`. See `_pilot-protocol.md`.
